# Misc Genomics Scripts
- **filter_contigs.py**: cleans up a _de novo_ assembly from SPAdes, Velvet, or IDBA (requires biopython). IDBA includes space-delimited data in their contig headers, and because SeqIO parses on whitespace, these will need to be removed or replaced (e.g., `sed -i 's/ /|/g' assembly.fna`). SPAdes and Velvet lack whitespace in their contig deflines, so those output files can be directly fed into this filtering script.
